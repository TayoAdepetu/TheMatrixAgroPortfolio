<h2>A Little About The Matrix Agro Project</h2>

<p>The TMatrix Agro Project is a web application built for <a href="https://matrix-agro.netlify.app">Matrix Agro</a> to serve as a central technology via which they can monitor there tens of Farmlands in several States in Nigeria.</p>

<p>The software was primarily built with Laravel API (a PHP Framework) and React Frontend.</p>

<p>The Matrix Agro technology has all needed features for monitoring multiple Farmlands technologically, including Inputs Management, Field Worker Management, Crop Planting pr Livestock Breeding Management, Crop/Livestock Sales Management, Assets Monitoring, Human Resource Management, Accounting, etc.</p>

<h2>Activity Scheduling</h2>

<p>The Matrix Agro Web Application lets the company manage all aspects of their agro-business, and that includes activities scheduling. This means the system lets you plan and schedule activities such as crop planting, livestock feeding, herbicide application, vaccination ahead of time and the necessary staff gets notification when it's time to carry out the activities. This ensures nothing is left undone and monitoring is adequate.</p>

<h2>Roles and Permissions</h2>
<p>Admin is able to assign roles and permissions to all employees in such a way that an employee can only do what is permitted by their access level within the system. This ensures security and privacy of data.</p>

<h2>Regular Reports</h2>

<p>The technology lets the staff with the necessary permissions give reports at various stages pf planting or breeding so that everything happening on the farm is well documented for record purposes, accountability, and high degree of responsiveness by stakeholders. The users have access to intuitive user interfaces that allow them to do all these and more.</p>

<h2>Accounting</h2>

<p>The system is also used to monitor what is going on in each farm in terms of yields, costs, and profitability. It is designed to be reactive in such a way that all farm input orders, planting activities, and other farm operations start and end on the system, and all the necessary data are updated in realtime as they are being used, harvested, and sold.</p>

<h2>Realtime Statistics</h2>

<p>The technology lets the business manage operations happening across their Framlands in various States from one single dashboard, filter statistics based on each location, state, staff, crop/livestock, etc.</p>
